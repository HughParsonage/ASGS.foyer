# ASGS.foyer 0.2.0

* `install_ASGS`: if one of ASGS's dependencies is not installed, `install_ASGS` now installs it rather than raising an error *after* the download has taken place. By default, the packages are installed then a second attempt at installation occurs 

# ASGS.foyer 0.1.0

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
